## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

CHALLENGES: 1. Simulator view 2. "Toggle keyboard" 3. Creating a README file
1	The tutorial video indicated we should be using a layout for an iPhone 5s, but the simulator view would not display the full screen. I managed to fix this by recreating the app for an iPhone 6S.
2	Tutorial indicated that the "toggle keyboard" feature might need to be selected from the drop down menu, but I didn't realize until my 2nd attempt at the app that I would need to reselct this multiple times throughout the process - the keyboard kept disappearing completely.
3	The instructions didn't indicate that the README file is created AFTER publishing the code on github. I spent a lot of time trying to do this in XCode and wound up messing up my original app beyond use and started over, which I figured would need to happen anyways since the simulator view would make a GIF impossible.
